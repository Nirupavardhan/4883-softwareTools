# Meld - File Comparison and Merge Tool

## Description
Meld is a powerful software tool that allows you to compare and merge two files, providing a visual representation of the differences between them. Whether you're a developer, a technical writer, or someone working with text-based files, Meld can help you track and understand changes made between different versions of files.

## Key Features
- **File Comparison**: Meld provides a side-by-side comparison view of two files, highlighting their differences.
- **Syntax Highlighting**: Meld supports syntax highlighting for various programming and markup languages, making it easier to identify changes within code files.
- **Inline Editing**: You can edit files directly within Meld, allowing you to make quick modifications during the comparison process.
- **Three-Way Comparison**: Meld supports three-way file comparison, enabling you to compare and merge changes between two files and a common ancestor file.
- **Visual Diff**: Changes between files are visually represented, making it easy to identify added, modified, or deleted lines of text.
- **Merge Functionality**: Meld includes powerful merge capabilities, allowing you to selectively accept or reject changes and create a merged version of the files.
- **Folder Comparison**: In addition to file comparison, Meld also supports folder comparison, helping you track changes between directories.
